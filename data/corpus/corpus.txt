**Earth: Our Fragile Home**

Earth, the third planet from the Sun, is a unique and vibrant oasis in the vast expanse of the universe. It is the only known celestial body to support life, making it a precious and irreplaceable home for millions of species, including humans. From its diverse ecosystems to its dynamic geological processes, Earth is a complex and interconnected system that has fascinated scientists, philosophers, and poets for centuries. Yet, despite its resilience, Earth is also fragile, facing unprecedented challenges due to human activity. Understanding and appreciating our planet is essential to ensuring its survival and the well-being of all its inhabitants.

One of Earth's most remarkable features is its ability to sustain life. This is made possible by a delicate balance of factors, including its distance from the Sun, the presence of water, and a protective atmosphere. Earth's atmosphere, composed primarily of nitrogen and oxygen, shields the planet from harmful solar radiation and regulates its temperature, creating a stable environment for life to thrive. Liquid water, which covers about 71% of the planet's surface, is another critical ingredient for life. It shapes landscapes, drives weather patterns, and serves as the foundation for ecosystems ranging from vast oceans to lush forests.

Earth's biodiversity is another testament to its uniqueness. The planet is home to an estimated 8.7 million species, each playing a role in the intricate web of life. From the microscopic bacteria that enrich soil to the majestic whales that roam the oceans, every organism contributes to the planet's ecological balance. Forests, grasslands, deserts, and coral reefs are just a few examples of the diverse habitats that support this rich tapestry of life. These ecosystems not only provide resources like food, medicine, and clean air but also inspire wonder and reverence for the natural world.

However, Earth's beauty and abundance are under threat. Human activities, such as deforestation, pollution, and the burning of fossil fuels, have disrupted the planet's delicate balance. Climate change, driven by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, is causing rising temperatures, melting ice caps, and more frequent extreme weather events. These changes threaten ecosystems, endanger species, and jeopardize the livelihoods of millions of people. Additionally, the overexploitation of natural resources and the loss of biodiversity are undermining the planet's ability to regenerate and sustain life.

Despite these challenges, there is hope. Across the globe, individuals, communities, and governments are taking action to protect and restore Earth's ecosystems. Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, are reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. Conservation efforts are helping to preserve endangered species and habitats. Innovations in technology and agriculture are promoting sustainable practices that minimize environmental impact. Education and awareness are also empowering people to make informed choices that benefit the planet.

Earth is more than just a planet; it is our shared home, a source of life, inspiration, and wonder. Its future depends on the choices we make today. By embracing sustainability, fostering a deeper connection with nature, and working together to address global challenges, we can ensure that Earth remains a thriving and vibrant home for generations to come. As the famous environmentalist John Muir once said, "The clearest way into the Universe is through a forest wilderness." Let us cherish and protect this extraordinary planet, for it is the only one we have.
**The Joys and Lessons of Travelling**

Travelling is one of life’s most enriching experiences, offering a unique blend of adventure, learning, and personal growth. It allows us to step out of our comfort zones, explore new cultures, and gain a deeper understanding of the world and ourselves. Whether it’s a weekend getaway to a nearby town or an international journey to a distant country, travelling has the power to transform our perspectives and create lasting memories.

One of the greatest joys of travelling is the opportunity to experience new cultures. Every destination has its own traditions, cuisines, and ways of life, and immersing ourselves in these differences broadens our horizons. Tasting exotic foods, learning a few phrases in a foreign language, or participating in local festivals can be both exciting and humbling. These experiences remind us of the diversity of human existence and foster a sense of empathy and respect for people from different backgrounds. Travelling teaches us that despite our differences, there is a shared humanity that connects us all.

Travelling also challenges us to adapt and grow. Navigating unfamiliar places, overcoming language barriers, and solving unexpected problems build resilience and resourcefulness. These experiences push us to step outside our routines and confront the unknown, often leading to personal breakthroughs. For instance, a solo traveler might discover newfound confidence, while a family trip might strengthen bonds and create cherished memories. The challenges of travelling, though sometimes frustrating, often become the most memorable and rewarding parts of the journey.

Moreover, travelling allows us to appreciate the beauty of the natural world. From towering mountains and pristine beaches to dense forests and bustling cities, our planet is filled with breathtaking landscapes and wonders. Witnessing these sights firsthand can inspire a sense of awe and gratitude, reminding us of the importance of preserving the environment for future generations. Travelling also encourages us to slow down and live in the moment, away from the distractions of daily life.

In a world that often feels divided, travelling has the power to unite people. It breaks down stereotypes, fosters understanding, and creates connections that transcend borders. By exploring the world, we not only learn about others but also gain a deeper understanding of ourselves. Travelling reminds us that life is an adventure, full of possibilities waiting to be discovered. As Saint Augustine once said, “The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page.” So, pack your bags, embrace the unknown, and let the journey begin.

The city market is a vibrant tapestry of sights, sounds, and smells, a living, breathing entity that pulses with energy from dawn until dusk. As you step into its labyrinthine alleys, you are immediately enveloped by a cacophony of voices—vendors hawking their wares, customers haggling over prices, and the occasional burst of laughter from a shared joke. The air is thick with the mingling aromas of sizzling street food, fresh produce, and the occasional whiff of incense from a nearby stall.

Stalls line the narrow pathways, each one a microcosm of commerce and culture. Brightly colored awnings stretch overhead, providing shade and adding a kaleidoscope of hues to the scene. Fruits and vegetables are stacked in meticulous pyramids, their vibrant colors—deep purples, radiant oranges, and lush greens—catching the eye. Vendors call out, their voices rising above the din, offering samples of juicy mangoes, crisp apples, and exotic fruits you can't quite name.

The meat section is a sensory overload, with butchers deftly wielding cleavers, their stalls adorned with cuts of meat hanging from hooks. The smell of raw meat mingles with the scent of fresh herbs and spices from neighboring stalls, where mounds of turmeric, cumin, and coriander are displayed in open sacks. The spice vendors, often elderly men with weathered hands, scoop portions into small plastic bags, their movements precise and practiced.

Further along, the textile section is a riot of color and pattern. Bolts of fabric in every conceivable hue are stacked high, their textures ranging from silky smooth to richly embroidered. Women run their hands over the materials, feeling the quality, while tailors nearby take measurements and jot them down in well-worn notebooks. The clatter of sewing machines adds a rhythmic backdrop to the scene.

In the food section, the air is filled with the tantalizing aroma of street food. Skewers of meat sizzle on open grills, their smoky scent mingling with the sweet, doughy smell of freshly baked bread. Vendors flip pancakes, stir bubbling pots of stew, and fry dumplings to a golden crisp. The sound of oil crackling and the sight of steam rising from hot dishes are irresistible, drawing in hungry patrons who eat standing up or perched on makeshift stools.

Amidst the commerce, there are moments of quiet humanity—a vendor sharing a cup of tea with a regular customer, a child playing with a stray kitten, an elderly woman meticulously arranging her flowers. The market is not just a place of trade but a community, a microcosm of the city itself, where lives intersect and stories unfold.

As the sun begins to set, the market takes on a different character. The harsh light of day softens, and the stalls are bathed in the warm glow of string lights and lanterns. The pace slows, but the energy remains, a testament to the enduring vitality of this bustling urban bazaar.
**The History of Space Exploration and Its Milestones**

Space exploration stands as one of humanity's most ambitious and inspiring endeavors, a testament to our innate curiosity and desire to push the boundaries of what is possible. From the earliest dreams of reaching the stars to the monumental achievements of modern science, the history of space exploration is a chronicle of innovation, perseverance, and collaboration. This essay traces the key milestones in this extraordinary journey, highlighting the pivotal moments that have shaped our understanding of the cosmos.

### The Dawn of Space Exploration

The origins of space exploration can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where myths and legends often depicted humans venturing into the heavens. However, the scientific foundation for space exploration was laid in the 17th century with the work of astronomers like Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton, who formulated the laws of planetary motion and gravity. These discoveries provided the theoretical framework necessary for understanding the mechanics of space travel.

The 20th century marked the beginning of practical efforts to explore space. In 1926, American engineer Robert H. Goddard launched the world's first liquid-fueled rocket, a breakthrough that paved the way for modern rocketry. Goddard's work inspired a new generation of scientists and engineers, including Wernher von Braun, who would later play a crucial role in the development of the V-2 rocket during World War II.

### The Space Race

The Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union catalyzed the rapid advancement of space exploration. The Space Race, as it came to be known, was a competition for technological and ideological supremacy, with each nation striving to achieve historic "firsts" in space.

The Soviet Union took an early lead with the launch of *Sputnik 1* on October 4, 1957. This small, beeping satellite became the first human-made object to orbit the Earth, marking the dawn of the space age. The success of *Sputnik* was followed by another Soviet milestone in 1961, when Yuri Gagarin became the first human to journey into space aboard *Vostok 1*. His 108-minute flight around the Earth was a monumental achievement that captured the world's imagination.

The United States, determined not to fall behind, established NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) in 1958 and embarked on its own ambitious program. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy set the audacious goal of landing a man on the Moon by the end of the decade. This vision culminated in the Apollo 11 mission on July 20, 1969, when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to set foot on the lunar surface. Armstrong's famous words, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind," symbolized the triumph of human ingenuity and exploration.

### Expanding Horizons

Following the Apollo program, space exploration entered a new phase characterized by international collaboration and the development of reusable spacecraft. The 1970s and 1980s saw the launch of space probes like *Voyager 1* and *Voyager 2*, which provided unprecedented insights into the outer planets of our solar system. These missions revealed the stunning complexity of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, and *Voyager 1* eventually became the first human-made object to enter interstellar space in 2012.

The Space Shuttle program, initiated by NASA in 1981, revolutionized space travel by introducing reusable spacecraft capable of carrying astronauts and cargo into orbit. The shuttles facilitated the construction of the International Space Station (ISS), a collaborative project involving multiple nations that has served as a microgravity laboratory since its first module was launched in 1998. The ISS represents a shining example of international cooperation, with astronauts from various countries living and working together to conduct scientific research.

### The Modern Era

In the 21st century, space exploration has become increasingly diverse, with both government agencies and private companies contributing to its advancement. NASA's Mars rovers, including *Spirit*, *Opportunity*, and *Curiosity*, have explored the Red Planet, uncovering evidence of past water and the potential for ancient life. The *Perseverance* rover, which landed on Mars in 2021, continues this legacy by searching for signs of microbial life and collecting samples for future return to Earth.

Meanwhile, private companies like SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk, have revolutionized space travel with innovations such as reusable rockets and ambitious plans for human colonization of Mars. SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft has successfully transported astronauts to the ISS, marking a new era of commercial spaceflight.

### The Future of Space Exploration

As we look to the future, space exploration holds boundless possibilities. Missions to return humans to the Moon, such as NASA's Artemis program, aim to establish a sustainable presence on the lunar surface and serve as a stepping stone for Mars exploration. Advances in technology, such as artificial intelligence and robotics, will further enhance our ability to explore distant worlds.

Moreover, the search for extraterrestrial life continues to captivate scientists and the public alike. Telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope, launched in 2021, are designed to peer into the farthest reaches of the universe, uncovering the secrets of distant galaxies and potentially habitable exoplanets.

### Conclusion

The history of space exploration is a testament to humanity's unyielding spirit of discovery. From the launch of *Sputnik* to the footsteps on the Moon and the exploration of distant planets, each milestone has expanded our understanding of the universe and our place within it. As we continue to reach for the stars, space exploration remains a powerful reminder of what we can achieve when we dare to dream and work together toward a common goal. The cosmos beckons, and our journey is far from over.

**Earth in 100 Years: A Vision of the Future**

Imagining Earth a century from now requires balancing optimism with realism, as the trajectory of our planet will depend on the choices humanity makes today. While challenges such as climate change, resource depletion, and technological disruption loom large, the potential for innovation, collaboration, and sustainable practices offers hope for a brighter future. In 2123, Earth could be a transformed world, shaped by both the consequences of past actions and the ingenuity of future generations.

### A Greener, More Sustainable Planet

One of the most striking changes in 2123 could be the widespread adoption of sustainable technologies and practices. By then, the global transition to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and geothermal power may be complete, rendering fossil fuels obsolete. Vast solar farms in deserts, towering wind turbines in oceans, and advanced energy storage systems could power cities and industries without emitting greenhouse gases. Urban areas might be dominated by vertical forests, green rooftops, and energy-efficient buildings designed to harmonize with nature rather than exploit it.

Transportation will likely be revolutionized, with electric and autonomous vehicles dominating roads, skies, and even underground tunnels. Hyperloop systems and high-speed maglev trains could connect cities across continents, reducing travel time and carbon footprints. Air travel might rely on hydrogen or electric propulsion, making it cleaner and more efficient. Meanwhile, reforestation efforts and the restoration of natural ecosystems could reverse decades of environmental degradation, bringing back biodiversity and stabilizing the climate.

### Technological Integration and Human Adaptation

Technology will undoubtedly play a central role in shaping life on Earth in 2123. Artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics could be seamlessly integrated into daily life, handling everything from household chores to complex medical procedures. Smart cities, powered by AI and the Internet of Things (IoT), might optimize resource use, reduce waste, and enhance the quality of life for their inhabitants. Advances in biotechnology could lead to breakthroughs in healthcare, extending human lifespans and eradicating diseases that are currently incurable.

However, the pervasive presence of technology will also raise ethical and societal questions. The line between humans and machines may blur, with brain-computer interfaces and augmented reality becoming commonplace. While these innovations could enhance human capabilities, they may also exacerbate inequalities if access to such technologies is not universal. Governments and societies will need to navigate these challenges carefully to ensure that progress benefits all.

### Climate Resilience and Adaptation

Despite humanity's best efforts, the Earth of 2123 will likely bear the scars of past environmental neglect. Rising sea levels may have submerged coastal cities, forcing mass migrations inland and prompting the construction of floating or underwater habitats. Advances in climate engineering, such as carbon capture and geoengineering, could mitigate some of the damage, but adaptation will be key. Communities might rely on drought-resistant crops, desalination plants, and weather-resistant infrastructure to thrive in a changing climate.

### A Global Community

In 2123, the world could be more interconnected than ever, with nations collaborating to address global challenges. The lessons learned from pandemics, climate crises, and resource shortages may have fostered a sense of shared responsibility and unity. Space exploration might also play a role in uniting humanity, with lunar bases and Mars colonies serving as symbols of collective ambition.

### Conclusion

The Earth of 2123 will be a product of the choices we make today. While the challenges are immense, the potential for positive change is equally great. By embracing sustainability, innovation, and cooperation, humanity can create a future where Earth remains a vibrant, thriving home for all its inhabitants. The next century will test our resilience and ingenuity, but it also offers an opportunity to redefine our relationship with the planet and each other.

The horse (Equus ferus caballus) is a domesticated, one-toed, hoofed mammal. It belongs to the taxonomic family Equidae and is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BCE, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BCE. Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.

Horses are adapted to run, allowing them to quickly escape predators, and possess an excellent sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response. Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses tending to sleep significantly more than adults.le horses, called mares, carry their young for approximately 11 months and a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following birth. Most domesticated horses begin training under a saddle or in a harness between the ages of two and four. They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years.

Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited "hot bloods" with speed and endurance; "cold bloods", such as draft horses and some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work; and "warmbloods", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe. There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today, developed for many different uses.

Horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits as well as in working activities such as police work, agriculture, entertainment, and therapy. Horses were historically used in warfare, from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed, using many different styles of equipment and methods of control. Many products are derived from horses, including meat, milk, hide, hair, bone, and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares. Humans provide domesticated horses with food, water, and shelter as well as attention from specialists such as veterinarians and farriers.

Biology
Main article: Equine anatomy
Diagram of a horse with some parts labeled.
Points of a horseic terms and specialized language are used to describe equine anatomy, different life stages, and colors and breeds.

Lifespan and life stages
Depending on breed, management and environment, the modern domestic horse has a life expectancy of 25 to 30 years. Uncommonly, a few animals live into their 40s and, occasionally, beyond.he oldest verifiable record was "Old Billy", a 19th-century horse that lived to the age of 62. In modern times, Sugar Puff, who had been listed in Guinness World Records as the world's oldest living pony, died in 2007 at age 56.]

Regardless of a horse or pony's actual birth date, for most competition purposes a year is added to its age each January 1 of each year in the Northern Hemispherend each August 1 in the Southern Hemisphere. The exception is in endurance riding, where the minimum age to compete is based on the animal's actual calendar age.]

The following terminology is used to describe horses of various ages:

Foal
A horse of either sex less than one year old. A nursing foal is sometimes called a suckling, and a foal that has been weaned is called a weanling. Most domesticated foals are weaned at five to seven months of age, although foals can be weaned at four months with no adverse physical effects.ng
A horse of either sex that is between one and two years old.
Colt
A male horse under the age of four. A common terminology error is to call any young horse a "colt", when the term actually only refers to young male horses.
Filly
A female horse under the age of four.re
A female horse four years old and older.
Stallion
A non-castrated male horse four years old and older.he term "horse" is sometimes used colloquially to refer specifically to a stallion.
Gelding
A castrated male horse of any age.In horse racing, these definitions may differ: For example, in the British Isles, Thoroughbred horse racing defines colts and fillies as less than five years old. However, Australian Thoroughbred racing defines colts and fillies as less than four years old.]

Size and measurement
The height of horses is measured at the highest point of the withers, where the neck meets the back. This point is used because it is a stable point of the anatomy, unlike the head or neck, which move up and down in relation to the body of the horse.

A large brown horse is chasing a small horse in a pasture.
Size varies greatly among horse breeds, as with this full-sized horse and small pony.
In English-speaking countries, the height of horses is often stated in units of hands and inches: one hand is equal to 4 inches (101.6 mm). The height is expressed as the number of full hands, followed by a point, then the number of additional inches, and ending with the abbreviation "h" or "hh" (for "hands high"). Thus, a horse described as "15.2 h" is 15 hands plus 2 inches, for a total of 62 inches (157.5 cm) in height.]

The size of horses varies by breed, but also is influenced by nutrition. Light-riding horses usually range in height from 14 to 16 hands (56 to 64 inches, 142 to 163 cm) and can weigh from 380 to 550 kilograms (840 to 1,210 lb). Larger-riding horses usually start at about 15.2 hands (62 inches, 157 cm) and often are as tall as 17 hands (68 inches, 173 cm), weighing from 500 to 600 kilograms (1,100 to 1,320 lb).vy or draft horses are usually at least 16 hands (64 inches, 163 cm) high and can be as tall as 18 hands (72 inches, 183 cm) high. They can weigh from about 700 to 1,000 kilograms (1,540 to 2,200 lb).

The largest horse in recorded history was probably a Shire horse named Mammoth, who was born in 1848. He stood 21.2 1⁄4 hands (86.25 inches, 219 cm) high and his peak weight was estimated at 1,524 kilograms (3,360 lb).he record holder for the smallest horse ever is Thumbelina, a fully mature miniature horse affected by dwarfism. She was 43 cm (17 in) tall and weighed 26 kg (57 lb).]

Ponies
Main article: Pony
Ponies are taxonomically the same animals as horses. The distinction between a horse and pony is commonly drawn on the basis of height, especially for competition purposes. However, height alone is not dispositive; the difference between horses and ponies may also include aspects of phenotype, including conformation and temperament.

The traditional standard for height of a horse or a pony at maturity is 14.2 hands (58 inches, 147 cm). An animal 14.2 hands (58 inches, 147 cm) or over is usually considered to be a horse and one less than 14.2 hands (58 inches, 147 cm) a pony, but there are many exceptions to the traditional standard. In Australia, ponies are considered to be those under 14 hands (56 inches, 142 cm).or competition in the Western division of the United States Equestrian Federation, the cutoff is 14.1 hands (57 inches, 145 cm). The International Federation for Equestrian Sports, the world governing body for horse sport, uses metric measurements and defines a pony as being any horse measuring less than 148 centimetres (58.27 in) at the withers without shoes, which is just over 14.2 hands (58 inches, 147 cm), and 149 centimetres (58.66 in; 14.2+1⁄2 hands), with shoes.]

Height is not the sole criterion for distinguishing horses from ponies. Breed registries for horses that typically produce individuals both under and over 14.2 hands (58 inches, 147 cm) consider all animals of that breed to be horses regardless of their height. Conversely, some pony breeds may have features in common with horses, and individual animals may occasionally mature at over 14.2 hands (58 inches, 147 cm), but are still considered to be ponies.]

Ponies often exhibit thicker manes, tails, and overall coat. They also have proportionally shorter legs, wider barrels, heavier bone, shorter and thicker necks, and short heads with broad foreheads. They may have calmer temperaments than horses and also a high level of intelligence that may or may not be used to cooperate with human handlers. Small size, by itself, is not an exclusive determinant. For example, the Shetland pony which averages 10 hands (40 inches, 102 cm), is considered a pony.ly, breeds such as the Falabella and other miniature horses, which can be no taller than 76 centimetres (30 in), are classified by their registries as very small horses, not ponies.

Genetics
Horses have 64 chromosomes.he horse genome was sequenced in 2007. It contains 2.7 billion DNA base pairs, which is larger than the dog genome, but smaller than the human genome or the bovine genome.he map is available to researchers.

Colors and markings
Two horses in a field. The one on the left is a dark brown with a black mane and tail. The one on the right is a light red all over.
Bay (left) and chestnut (sometimes called "sorrel") are two of the most common coat colors, seen in almost all breeds.
Main articles: Equine coat color, Equine coat color genetics, and Horse markings
Horses exhibit a diverse array of coat colors and distinctive markings, described by a specialized vocabulary. Often, a horse is classified first by its coat color, before breed or sex.es of the same color may be distinguished from one another by white markings, which, along with various spotting patterns, are inherited separately from coat color.]

Many genes that create horse coat colors and patterns have been identified. Current genetic tests can identify at least 13 different alleles influencing coat color, and research continues to discover new genes linked to specific traits. The basic coat colors of chestnut and black are determined by the gene controlled by the Melanocortin 1 receptor,so known as the "extension gene" or "red factor," as its recessive form is "red" (chestnut) and its dominant form is black.al genes control suppression of black color to point coloration that results in a bay, spotting patterns such as pinto or leopard, dilution genes such as palomino or dun, as well as greying, and all the other factors that create the many possible coat colors found in horses.

Horses that have a white coat color are often mislabeled; a horse that looks "white" is usually a middle-aged or older gray. Grays are born a darker shade, get lighter as they age, but usually keep black skin underneath their white hair coat (with the exception of pink skin under white markings). The only horses properly called white are born with a predominantly white hair coat and pink skin, a fairly rare occurrence.nt and unrelated genetic factors can produce white coat colors in horses, including several different alleles of dominant white and the sabino-1 gene. However, there are no "albino" horses, defined as having both pink skin and red eyes.]

Reproduction and development
Main article: Horse breeding

Mare with a foal
Gestation lasts approximately 340 days, with an average range 320–370 days, and usually results in one foal; twins are rare.es are a precocial species, and foals are capable of standing and running within a short time following birth. Foals are usually born in the spring. The estrous cycle of a mare occurs roughly every 19–22 days and occurs from early spring into autumn. Most mares enter an anestrus period during the winter and thus do not cycle in this period.ls are generally weaned from their mothers between four and six months of age.

Horses, particularly colts, are sometimes physically capable of reproduction at about 18 months, but domesticated horses are rarely allowed to breed before the age of three, especially females.es four years old are considered mature, although the skeleton normally continues to develop until the age of six; maturation also depends on the horse's size, breed, sex, and quality of care. Larger horses have larger bones; therefore, not only do the bones take longer to form bone tissue, but the epiphyseal plates are larger and take longer to convert from cartilage to bone. These plates convert after the other parts of the bones, and are crucial to development.

Depending on maturity, breed, and work expected, horses are usually put under saddle and trained to be ridden between the ages of two and four.gh Thoroughbred race horses are put on the track as young as the age of two in some countries, horses specifically bred for sports such as dressage are generally not put under saddle until they are three or four years old, because their bones and muscles are not solidly developed.or endurance riding competition, horses are not deemed mature enough to compete until they are a full 60 calendar months (five years) old.

Anatomy

Skeletal system
Main article: Skeletal system of the horse
Diagram of a horse skeleton with major parts labeled.
The skeletal system of a modern horse
The horse skeleton averages 205 bones. A significant difference between the horse skeleton and that of a human is the lack of a collarbone—the horse's forelimbs are attached to the spinal column by a powerful set of muscles, tendons, and ligaments that attach the shoulder blade to the torso. The horse's four legs and hooves are also unique structures. Their leg bones are proportioned differently from those of a human. For example, the body part that is called a horse's "knee" is actually made up of the carpal bones that correspond to the human wrist. Similarly, the hock contains bones equivalent to those in the human ankle and heel. The lower leg bones of a horse correspond to the bones of the human hand or foot, and the fetlock (incorrectly called the "ankle") is actually the proximal sesamoid bones between the cannon bones (a single equivalent to the human metacarpal or metatarsal bones) and the proximal phalanges, located where one finds the "knuckles" of a human. A horse also has no muscles in its legs below the knees and hocks, only skin, hair, bone, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and the assorted specialized tissues that make up the hoof.

Hooves
Main articles: Horse hoof, Horseshoe, and Farrier
The critical importance of the feet and legs is summed up by the traditional adage, "no foot, no horse".he horse hoof begins with the distal phalanges, the equivalent of the human fingertip or tip of the toe, surrounded by cartilage and other specialized, blood-rich soft tissues such as the laminae. The exterior hoof wall and horn of the sole is made of keratin, the same material as a human fingernail. The result is that a horse, weighing on average 500 kilograms (1,100 lb),ls on the same bones as would a human on tiptoe. For the protection of the hoof under certain conditions, some horses have horseshoes placed on their feet by a professional farrier. The hoof continually grows, and in most domesticated horses needs to be trimmed (and horseshoes reset, if used) every five to eight weeks,gh the hooves of horses in the wild wear down and regrow at a rate suitable for their terrain.

Teeth
Main article: Horse teeth
Horses are adapted to grazing. In an adult horse, there are 12 incisors at the front of the mouth, adapted to biting off the grass or other vegetation. There are 24 teeth adapted for chewing, the premolars and molars, at the back of the mouth. Stallions and geldings have four additional teeth just behind the incisors, a type of canine teeth called "tushes". Some horses, both male and female, will also develop one to four very small vestigial teeth in front of the molars, known as "wolf" teeth, which are generally removed because they can interfere with the bit. There is an empty interdental space between the incisors and the molars where the bit rests directly on the gums, or "bars" of the horse's mouth when the horse is bridled.

An estimate of a horse's age can be made from looking at its teeth. The teeth continue to erupt throughout life and are worn down by grazing. Therefore, the incisors show changes as the horse ages; they develop a distinct wear pattern, changes in tooth shape, and changes in the angle at which the chewing surfaces meet. This allows a very rough estimate of a horse's age, although diet and veterinary care can also affect the rate of tooth wear.]

Digestion
Main articles: Equine digestive system and Equine nutrition
Horses are herbivores with a digestive system adapted to a forage diet of grasses and other plant material, consumed steadily throughout the day. Therefore, compared to humans, they have a relatively small stomach but very long intestines to facilitate a steady flow of nutrients. A 450-kilogram (990 lb) horse will eat 7 to 11 kilograms (15 to 24 lb) of food per day and, under normal use, drink 38 to 45 litres (8.4 to 9.9 imp gal; 10 to 12 US gal) of water. Horses are not ruminants, they have only one stomach, like humans, but unlike humans, they can use cellulose, a major component of grass. Horses are hindgut fermenters. Cellulose fermentation by symbiotic bacteria occurs in the cecum, or "water gut", which food goes through before reaching the large intestine. Horses cannot vomit, so digestion problems can quickly cause colic, a leading cause of death. Horses do not have a gallbladder; however, they seem to tolerate high amounts of fat in their diet despite lack of a gallbladder.70]

Senses

See also: Equine vision
The horses' senses are based on their status as prey animals, where they must be aware of their surroundings at all times. They have the largest eyes of any land mammal,nd are lateral-eyed, meaning that their eyes are positioned on the sides of their heads. This means that horses have a range of vision of more than 350°, with approximately 65° of this being binocular vision and the remaining 285° monocular vision.es have excellent day and night vision, but they have two-color, or dichromatic vision; their color vision is somewhat like red-green color blindness in humans, where certain colors, especially red and related colors, appear as a shade of green.

Their sense of smell, while much better than that of humans, is not quite as good as that of a dog. It is believed to play a key role in the social interactions of horses as well as detecting other key scents in the environment. Horses have two olfactory centers. The first system is in the nostrils and nasal cavity, which analyze a wide range of odors. The second, located under the nasal cavity, are the vomeronasal organs, also called Jacobson's organs. These have a separate nerve pathway to the brain and appear to primarily analyze pheromones.]

A horse's hearing is good, and the pinna of each ear can rotate up to 180°, giving the potential for 360° hearing without having to move the head.se impacts the behavior of horses and certain kinds of noise may contribute to stress: A 2013 study in the UK indicated that stabled horses were calmest in a quiet setting, or if listening to country or classical music, but displayed signs of nervousness when listening to jazz or rock music. This study also recommended keeping music under a volume of 21 decibels. An Australian study found that stabled racehorses listening to talk radio had a higher rate of gastric ulcers than horses listening to music, and racehorses stabled where a radio was played had a higher overall rate of ulceration than horses stabled where there was no radio playing.]

Horses have a great sense of balance, due partly to their ability to feel their footing and partly to highly developed proprioception—the unconscious sense of where the body and limbs are at all times. A horse's sense of touch is well-developed. The most sensitive areas are around the eyes, ears, and nose.es are able to sense contact as subtle as an insect landing anywhere on the body.

Horses have an advanced sense of taste, which allows them to sort through fodder and choose what they would most like to eat,nd their prehensile lips can easily sort even small grains. Horses generally will not eat poisonous plants, however, there are exceptions; horses will occasionally eat toxic amounts of poisonous plants even when there is adequate healthy food.

Gallop 40–48 km/h (25–30 mph), record: 70.76 km/h (43.97 mph)

All horses move naturally with four basic gaits:]

the four-beat walk, which averages 6.4 kilometres per hour (4.0 mph);
the two-beat trot or jog at 13 to 19 kilometres per hour (8.1 to 11.8 mph) (faster for harness racing horses);
the canter or lope, a three-beat gait that is 19 to 24 kilometres per hour (12 to 15 mph);
the gallop, which averages 40 to 48 kilometres per hour (25 to 30 mph), but the world record for a horse galloping over a short, sprint distance is 70.76 kilometres per hour (43.97 mph).es these basic gaits, some horses perform a two-beat pace, instead of the trot. There also are several four-beat 'ambling' gaits that are approximately the speed of a trot or pace, though smoother to ride. These include the lateral rack, running walk, and tölt as well as the diagonal fox trot.ng gaits are often genetic in some breeds, known collectively as gaited horses. These horses replace the trot with one of the ambling gaits.]

Behavior
Main articles: Horse behavior and Stable vices
0:03
Horse neigh
Horses are prey animals with a strong fight-or-flight response. Their first reaction to a threat is to startle and usually flee, although they will stand their ground and defend themselves when flight is impossible or if their young are threatened. They also tend to be curious; when startled, they will often hesitate an instant to ascertain the cause of their fright, and may not always flee from something that they perceive as non-threatening. Most light horse riding breeds were developed for speed, agility, alertness and endurance; natural qualities that extend from their wild ancestors. However, through selective breeding, some breeds of horses are quite docile, particularly certain draft horses.]

Horses are herd animals, with a clear hierarchy of rank, led by a dominant individual, usually a mare. They are also social creatures that are able to form companionship attachments to their own species and to other animals, including humans. They communicate in various ways, including vocalizations such as nickering or whinnying, mutual grooming, and body language. Many horses will become difficult to manage if they are isolated, but with training, horses can learn to accept a human as a companion, and thus be comfortable away from other horses. However, when confined with insufficient companionship, exercise, or stimulation, individuals may develop stable vices, an assortment of bad habits, mostly stereotypies of psychological origin, that include wood chewing, wall kicking, "weaving" (rocking back and forth), and other problems.]

Intelligence and learning
Studies have indicated that horses perform a number of cognitive tasks on a daily basis, meeting mental challenges that include food procurement and identification of individuals within a social system. They also have good spatial discrimination abilities. They are naturally curious and apt to investigate things they have not seen before.es have assessed equine intelligence in areas such as problem solving, speed of learning, and memory. Horses excel at simple learning, but also are able to use more advanced cognitive abilities that involve categorization and concept learning. They can learn using habituation, desensitization, classical conditioning, and operant conditioning, and positive and negative reinforcement. One study has indicated that horses can differentiate between "more or less" if the quantity involved is less than four.]

Domesticated horses may face greater mental challenges than wild horses, because they live in artificial environments that prevent instinctive behavior whilst also learning tasks that are not natural. Horses are animals of habit that respond well to regimentation, and respond best when the same routines and techniques are used consistently. One trainer believes that "intelligent" horses are reflections of intelligent trainers who effectively use response conditioning techniques and positive reinforcement to train in the style that best fits with an individual animal's natural inclinations.]

Temperament
Main articles: Draft horse, Warmblood, and Oriental horse
Horses are mammals, and as such are warm-blooded, or endothermic creatures, as opposed to cold-blooded, or poikilothermic animals. However, these words have developed a separate meaning in the context of equine terminology, used to describe temperament, not body temperature. For example, the "hot-bloods", such as many race horses, exhibit more sensitivity and energy, while the "cold-bloods", such as most draft breeds, are quieter and calmer.es "hot-bloods" are classified as "light horses" or "riding horses", with the "cold-bloods" classified as "draft horses" or "work horses".]

Illustration of assorted breeds; slim, light hotbloods, medium-sized warmbloods and draft and pony-type coldblood breeds
"Hot blooded" breeds include "oriental horses" such as the Akhal-Teke, Arabian horse, Barb, and now-extinct Turkoman horse, as well as the Thoroughbred, a breed developed in England from the older oriental breeds. Hot bloods tend to be spirited, bold, and learn quickly. They are bred for agility and speed.ey tend to be physically refined—thin-skinned, slim, and long-legged. The original oriental breeds were brought to Europe from the Middle East and North Africa when European breeders wished to infuse these traits into racing and light cavalry horses.06]

Muscular, heavy draft horses are known as "cold bloods", as they are bred not only for strength, but also to have the calm, patient temperament needed to pull a plow or a heavy carriage full of people. They are sometimes nicknamed "gentle giants".ll-known draft breeds include the Belgian and the Clydesdale. Some, like the Percheron, are lighter and livelier, developed to pull carriages or to plow large fields in drier climates.rs, such as the Shire, are slower and more powerful, bred to plow fields with heavy, clay-based soils. The cold-blooded group also includes some pony breeds.]

"Warmblood" breeds, such as the Trakehner or Hanoverian, developed when European carriage and war horses were crossed with Arabians or Thoroughbreds, producing a riding horse with more refinement than a draft horse, but greater size and milder temperament than a lighter breed. Certain pony breeds with warmblood characteristics have been developed for smaller riders.ds are considered a "light horse" or "riding horse".

Today, the term "Warmblood" refers to a specific subset of sport horse breeds that are used for competition in dressage and show jumping.ly speaking, the term "warm blood" refers to any cross between cold-blooded and hot-blooded breeds. Examples include breeds such as the Irish Draught or the Cleveland Bay. The term was once used to refer to breeds of light riding horse other than Thoroughbreds or Arabians, such as the Morgan horse.]

Sleep patterns
See also: Horse sleep patterns and Sleep in non-humans
Two horses in a pasture, one is standing beside the other that is laying down.
When horses lie down to sleep, others in the herd remain standing, awake, or in a light doze, keeping watch.
Horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down. In an adaptation from life in the wild, horses are able to enter light sleep by using a "stay apparatus" in their legs, allowing them to doze without collapsing. Horses sleep better when in groups because some animals will sleep while others stand guard to watch for predators. A horse kept alone will not sleep well because its instincts are to keep a constant eye out for danger.]

Unlike humans, horses do not sleep in a solid, unbroken period of time, but take many short periods of rest. Horses spend four to fifteen hours a day in standing rest, and from a few minutes to several hours lying down. Total sleep time in a 24-hour period may range from several minutes to a couple of hours, mostly in short intervals of about 15 minutes each.he average sleep time of a domestic horse is said to be 2.9 hours per day.

Horses must lie down to reach REM sleep. They only have to lie down for an hour or two every few days to meet their minimum REM sleep requirements.er, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may suddenly collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while still standing. This condition differs from narcolepsy, although horses may also suffer from that disorder.]

Taxonomy and evolution

Main articles: Evolution of the horse, Equus (genus), and Equidae
The horse adapted to survive in areas of wide-open terrain with sparse vegetation, surviving in an ecosystem where other large grazing animals, especially ruminants, could not. Horses and other equids are odd-toed ungulates of the order Perissodactyla, a group of mammals dominant during the Tertiary period. In the past, this order contained 14 families, but only three—Equidae (the horse and related species), Tapiridae (the tapir), and Rhinocerotidae (the rhinoceroses)—have survived to the present day.]

The earliest known member of the family Equidae was the Hyracotherium, which lived between 45 and 55 million years ago, during the Eocene period. It had 4 toes on each front foot, and 3 toes on each back foot. The extra toe on the front feet soon disappeared with the Mesohippus, which lived 32 to 37 million years ago.er time, the extra side toes shrank in size until they vanished. All that remains of them in modern horses is a set of small vestigial bones on the leg below the knee, known informally as splint bones.ir legs also lengthened as their toes disappeared until they were a hooved animal capable of running at great speed. By about 5 million years ago, the modern Equus had evolved.id teeth also evolved from browsing on soft, tropical plants to adapt to browsing of drier plant material, then to grazing of tougher plains grasses. Thus proto-horses changed from leaf-eating forest-dwellers to grass-eating inhabitants of semi-arid regions worldwide, including the steppes of Eurasia and the Great Plains of North America.

By about 15,000 years ago, Equus ferus was a widespread holarctic species. Horse bones from this time period, the late Pleistocene, are found in Europe, Eurasia, Beringia, and North America. Yet between 10,000 and 7,600 years ago, the horse became extinct in North America and rare elsewhere.30] The reasons for this extinction are not fully known, but one theory notes that extinction in North America paralleled human arrival.er theory points to climate change, noting that approximately 12,500 years ago, the grasses characteristic of a steppe ecosystem gave way to shrub tundra, which was covered with unpalatable plants.

Main article: Wild horse
A truly wild horse is a species or subspecies with no ancestors that were ever domesticated. Therefore, most "wild" horses today are actually feral horses, animals that escaped or were turned loose from domestic herds and the descendants of those animals.ly two wild subspecies, the tarpan and the Przewalski's horse, survived into recorded history and only the latter survives today.

The Przewalski's horse (Equus ferus przewalskii), named after the Russian explorer Nikolai Przhevalsky, is a rare Asian animal. It is also known as the Mongolian wild horse; Mongolian people know it as the taki, and the Kyrgyz people call it a kirtag. The subspecies was presumed extinct in the wild between 1969 and 1992, while a small breeding population survived in zoos around the world. In 1992, it was reestablished in the wild by the conservation efforts of numerous zoos. Today, a small wild breeding population exists in Mongolia.37] There are additional animals still maintained at zoos throughout the world.

The question of whether the Przewalski's horse was ever domesticated was challenged in 2018 when DNA studies of horses found at Botai culture sites revealed captured animals with DNA markers of an ancestor to the Przewalski's horse. The study concluded that the Botai animals appear to have been an independent domestication attempt involving a different wild population from all other domesticated horses. However, the question of whether all Przewalski's horses descend from this domesticated population is unresolved, as only one of seven modern Przewalski’s horses in the study shared this ancestry.40]

The tarpan or European wild horse (Equus ferus ferus) was found in Europe and much of Asia. It survived into the historical era, but became extinct in 1909, when the last captive died in a Russian zoo. Thus, the genetic line was lost. Attempts have been made to recreate the tarpan,42] which resulted in horses with outward physical similarities, but nonetheless descended from domesticated ancestors and not true wild horses.

Periodically, populations of horses in isolated areas are speculated to be relict populations of wild horses, but generally have been proven to be feral or domestic. For example, the Riwoche horse of Tibet was proposed as such,ut testing did not reveal genetic differences from domesticated horses. Similarly, the Sorraia of Portugal was proposed as a direct descendant of the Tarpan on the basis of shared characteristics,46] but genetic studies have shown that the Sorraia is more closely related to other horse breeds, and that the outward similarity is an unreliable measure of relatedness.]

Other modern equids
Main article: Equus (genus)
Besides the horse, there are six other species of genus Equus in the Equidae family. These are the ass or donkey, Equus asinus; the mountain zebra, Equus zebra; plains zebra, Equus quagga; Grévy's Zebra, Equus grevyi; the kiang, Equus kiang; and the onager, Equus hemionus.

Horses can crossbreed with other members of their genus. The most common hybrid is the mule, a cross between a "jack" (male donkey) and a mare. A related hybrid, a hinny, is a cross between a stallion and a "jenny" (female donkey).er hybrids include the zorse, a cross between a zebra and a horse. With rare exceptions, most hybrids are sterile and cannot reproduce.]

Domestication
Main articles: History of horse domestication theories and Domestication of the horse

Domestication of the horse most likely took place in central Asia prior to 3500 BCE. Two major sources of information are used to determine where and when the horse was first domesticated and how the domesticated horse spread around the world. The first source is based on palaeological and archaeological discoveries; the second source is a comparison of DNA obtained from modern horses to that from bones and teeth of ancient horse remains.

The earliest archaeological evidence for the domestication of the horse comes from sites in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, dating to approximately 4000–3500 BCE.54] By 3000 BCE, the horse was completely domesticated and by 2000 BCE there was a sharp increase in the number of horse bones found in human settlements in northwestern Europe, indicating the spread of domesticated horses throughout the continent. The most recent, but most irrefutable evidence of domestication comes from sites where horse remains were interred with chariots in graves of the Sintashta and Petrovka cultures c. 2100 BCE.]

A 2021 genetic study suggested that most modern domestic horses descend from the lower Volga-Don region. Ancient horse genomes indicate that these populations influenced almost all local populations as they expanded rapidly throughout Eurasia, beginning about 4,200 years ago. It also shows that certain adaptations were strongly selected due to riding, and that equestrian material culture, including Sintashta spoke-wheeled chariots spread with the horse itself.]

Domestication is also studied by using the genetic material of present-day horses and comparing it with the genetic material present in the bones and teeth of horse remains found in archaeological and palaeological excavations. The variation in the genetic material shows that very few wild stallions contributed to the domestic horse,le many mares were part of early domesticated herds.62] This is reflected in the difference in genetic variation between the DNA that is passed on along the paternal, or sire line (Y-chromosome) versus that passed on along the maternal, or dam line (mitochondrial DNA). There are very low levels of Y-chromosome variability,ut a great deal of genetic variation in mitochondrial DNA.62] There is also regional variation in mitochondrial DNA due to the inclusion of wild mares in domestic herds.62] Another characteristic of domestication is an increase in coat color variation.In horses, this increased dramatically between 5000 and 3000 BCE.

Before the availability of DNA techniques to resolve the questions related to the domestication of the horse, various hypotheses were proposed. One classification was based on body types and conformation, suggesting the presence of four basic prototypes that had adapted to their environment prior to domestication.er hypothesis held that the four prototypes originated from a single wild species and that all different body types were entirely a result of selective breeding after domestication. However, the lack of a detectable substructure in the horse has resulted in a rejection of both hypotheses.

Feral populations
Main article: Feral horse
Feral horses are born and live in the wild, but are descended from domesticated animals.ny populations of feral horses exist throughout the world.es of feral herds have provided useful insights into the behavior of prehistoric horses, as well as greater understanding of the instincts and behaviors that drive horses that live in domesticated conditions.]

There are also semi-feral horses in many parts of the world, such as Dartmoor and the New Forest in the UK, where the animals are all privately owned but live for significant amounts of time in "wild" conditions on undeveloped, often public, lands. Owners of such animals often pay a fee for grazing rights.]

Breeds
Main articles: Horse breed, List of horse breeds, and Horse breeding
The concept of purebred bloodstock and a controlled, written breed registry has come to be particularly significant and important in modern times. Sometimes purebred horses are incorrectly or inaccurately called "thoroughbreds". Thoroughbred is a specific breed of horse, while a "purebred" is a horse (or any other animal) with a defined pedigree recognized by a breed registry. Horse breeds are groups of horses with distinctive characteristics that are transmitted consistently to their offspring, such as conformation, color, performance ability, or disposition. These inherited traits result from a combination of natural crosses and artificial selection methods. Horses have been selectively bred since their domestication. An early example of people who practiced selective horse breeding were the Bedouin, who had a reputation for careful practices, keeping extensive pedigrees of their Arabian horses and placing great value upon pure bloodlines.se pedigrees were originally transmitted via an oral tradition. In the 14th century, Carthusian monks of southern Spain kept meticulous pedigrees of bloodstock lineages still found today in the Andalusian horse.]

Breeds developed due to a need for "form to function", the necessity to develop certain characteristics in order to perform a particular type of work. Thus, a powerful but refined breed such as the Andalusian developed as riding horses with an aptitude for dressage.vy draft horses were developed out of a need to perform demanding farm work and pull heavy wagons. Other horse breeds had been developed specifically for light agricultural work, carriage and road work, various sport disciplines, or simply as pets.me breeds developed through centuries of crossing other breeds, while others descended from a single foundation sire, or other limited or restricted foundation bloodstock. One of the earliest formal registries was General Stud Book for Thoroughbreds, which began in 1791 and traced back to the foundation bloodstock for the breed. There are more than 300 horse breeds in the world today.]

Interaction with humans

Worldwide, horses play a role within human cultures and have done so for millennia. Horses are used for leisure activities, sports, and working purposes. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that in 2008, there were almost 59,000,000 horses in the world, with around 33,500,000 in the Americas, 13,800,000 in Asia and 6,300,000 in Europe and smaller portions in Africa and Oceania. There are estimated to be 9,500,000 horses in the United States alone. The American Horse Council estimates that horse-related activities have a direct impact on the economy of the United States of over $39 billion, and when indirect spending is considered, the impact is over $102 billion.In a 2004 "poll" conducted by Animal Planet, more than 50,000 viewers from 73 countries voted for the horse as the world's 4th favorite animal.

Communication between human and horse is paramount in any equestrian activity;to aid this process horses are usually ridden with a saddle on their backs to assist the rider with balance and positioning, and a bridle or related headgear to assist the rider in maintaining control. Sometimes horses are ridden without a saddle,nd occasionally, horses are trained to perform without a bridle or other headgear. Many horses are also driven, which requires a harness, bridle, and some type of vehicle.]

Historically, equestrians honed their skills through games and races. Equestrian sports provided entertainment for crowds and honed the excellent horsemanship that was needed in battle. Many sports, such as dressage, eventing, and show jumping, have origins in military training, which were focused on control and balance of both horse and rider. Other sports, such as rodeo, developed from practical skills such as those needed on working ranches and stations. Sport hunting from horseback evolved from earlier practical hunting techniques. Horse racing of all types evolved from impromptu competitions between riders or drivers. All forms of competition, requiring demanding and specialized skills from both horse and rider, resulted in the systematic development of specialized breeds and equipment for each sport. The popularity of equestrian sports through the centuries has resulted in the preservation of skills that would otherwise have disappeared after horses stopped being used in combat.]

Horses are trained to be ridden or driven in a variety of sporting competitions. Examples include show jumping, dressage, three-day eventing, competitive driving, endurance riding, gymkhana, rodeos, and fox hunting. Horse shows, which have their origins in medieval European fairs, are held around the world. They host a huge range of classes, covering all of the mounted and harness disciplines, as well as "In-hand" classes where the horses are led, rather than ridden, to be evaluated on their conformation. The method of judging varies with the discipline, but winning usually depends on style and ability of both horse and rider.ts such as polo do not judge the horse itself, but rather use the horse as a partner for human competitors as a necessary part of the game. Although the horse requires specialized training to participate, the details of its performance are not judged, only the result of the rider's actions—be it getting a ball through a goal or some other task. Examples of these sports of partnership between human and horse include jousting, in which the main goal is for one rider to unseat the other,nd buzkashi, a team game played throughout Central Asia, the aim being to capture a goat carcass while on horseback.

Horse racing is an equestrian sport and major international industry, watched in almost every nation of the world. There are three types: "flat" racing; steeplechasing, i.e. racing over jumps; and harness racing, where horses trot or pace while pulling a driver in a small, light cart known as a sulky. A major part of horse racing's economic importance lies in the gambling associated with it.

There are certain jobs that horses do very well, and no technology has yet developed to fully replace them. For example, mounted police horses are still effective for certain types of patrol duties and crowd control.le ranches still require riders on horseback to round up cattle that are scattered across remote, rugged terrain. Search and rescue organizations in some countries depend upon mounted teams to locate people, particularly hikers and children, and to provide disaster relief assistance.es can also be used in areas where it is necessary to avoid vehicular disruption to delicate soil, such as nature reserves. They may also be the only form of transport allowed in wilderness areas. Horses are quieter than motorized vehicles. Law enforcement officers such as park rangers or game wardens may use horses for patrols, and horses or mules may also be used for clearing trails or other work in areas of rough terrain where vehicles are less effective.

Although machinery has replaced horses in many parts of the world, an estimated 100 million horses, donkeys and mules are still used for agriculture and transportation in less developed areas. This number includes around 27 million working animals in Africa alone.me land management practices such as cultivating and logging can be efficiently performed with horses. In agriculture, less fossil fuel is used and increased environmental conservation occurs over time with the use of draft animals such as horses.ng with horses can result in reduced damage to soil structure and less damage to trees due to more selective logging.

Warfare

Horses have been used in warfare for most of recorded history. The first archaeological evidence of horses used in warfare dates to between 4000 and 3000 BCE,nd the use of horses in warfare was widespread by the end of the Bronze Age.gh mechanization has largely replaced the horse as a weapon of war, horses are still seen today in limited military uses, mostly for ceremonial purposes, or for reconnaissance and transport activities in areas of rough terrain where motorized vehicles are ineffective. Horses have been used in the 21st century by the Janjaweed militias in the War in Darfur.

Modern horses are often used to reenact many of their historical work purposes. Horses are used, complete with equipment that is authentic or a meticulously recreated replica, in various live action historical reenactments of specific periods of history, especially recreations of famous battles.es are also used to preserve cultural traditions and for ceremonial purposes. Countries such as the United Kingdom still use horse-drawn carriages to convey royalty and other VIPs to and from certain culturally significant events. Public exhibitions are another example, such as the Budweiser Clydesdales, seen in parades and other public settings, a team of draft horses that pull a beer wagon similar to that used before the invention of the modern motorized truck.]

Horses are frequently used in television, films and literature. They are sometimes featured as a major character in films about particular animals, but also used as visual elements that assure the accuracy of historical stories. Both live horses and iconic images of horses are used in advertising to promote a variety of products.he horse frequently appears in coats of arms in heraldry, in a variety of poses and equipment. The mythologies of many cultures, including Greco-Roman, Hindu, Islamic, and Norse, include references to both normal horses and those with wings or additional limbs, and multiple myths also call upon the horse to draw the chariots of the Moon and Sun.he horse also appears in the 12-year cycle of animals in the Chinese zodiac related to the Chinese calendar. Horses serve as the inspiration for many modern automobile names and logos, including the Ford Pinto, Ford Bronco, Ford Mustang, Hyundai Equus, Hyundai Pony, Mitsubishi Starion, Subaru Brumby, Mitsubishi Colt/Dodge Colt, Volkswagen Polo, Pinzgauer, Steyr-Puch Haflinger, Pegaso, Porsche, Rolls-Royce Camargue, Ferrari, Carlsson, Kamaz, Corre La Licorne, Iran Khodro, Eicher, and Baojun.17]

Therapeutic use

People of all ages with physical and mental disabilities obtain beneficial results from an association with horses. Therapeutic riding is used to mentally and physically stimulate disabled persons and help them improve their lives through improved balance and coordination, increased self-confidence, and a greater feeling of freedom and independence.he benefits of equestrian activity for people with disabilities has also been recognized with the addition of equestrian events to the Paralympic Games and recognition of para-equestrian events by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI). Hippotherapy and therapeutic horseback riding are names for different physical, occupational, and speech therapy treatment strategies that use equine movement. In hippotherapy, a therapist uses the horse's movement to improve their patient's cognitive, coordination, balance, and fine motor skills, whereas therapeutic horseback riding uses specific riding skills.]

Horses also provide psychological benefits to people whether they actually ride or not. "Equine-assisted" or "equine-facilitated" therapy is a form of experiential psychotherapy that uses horses as companion animals to assist people with mental illness, including anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, mood disorders, behavioral difficulties, and those who are going through major life changes. There are also experimental programs using horses in prison settings. Exposure to horses appears to improve the behavior of inmates and help reduce recidivism when they leave.]

Products
Horses are raw material for many products made by humans throughout history, including byproducts from the slaughter of horses as well as materials collected from living horses.

Products collected from living horses include mare's milk, used by people with large horse herds, such as the Mongols, who let it ferment to produce kumis. Horse blood was once used as food by the Mongols and other nomadic tribes, who found it a convenient source of nutrition when traveling. Drinking their own horses' blood allowed the Mongols to ride for extended periods of time without stopping to eat.he drug Premarin is a mixture of estrogens extracted from the urine of pregnant mares (pregnant mares' urine), and was previously a widely used drug for hormone replacement therapy. The tail hair of horses can be used for making bows for string instruments such as the violin, viola, cello, and double bass.]

Horse meat has been used as food for humans and carnivorous animals throughout the ages. Approximately 5 million horses are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide. It is eaten in many parts of the world, though consumption is taboo in some cultures,nd a subject of political controversy in others. Horsehide leather has been used for boots, gloves, jackets,ls, and baseball gloves. Horse hooves can also be used to produce animal glue.se bones can be used to make implements. Specifically, in Italian cuisine, the horse tibia is sharpened into a probe called a spinto, which is used to test the readiness of a (pig) ham as it cures.In Asia, the saba is a horsehide vessel used in the production of kumis.

Horses are grazing animals, and their major source of nutrients is good-quality forage from hay or pasture.ey can consume approximately 2% to 2.5% of their body weight in dry feed each day. Therefore, a 450-kilogram (990 lb) adult horse could eat up to 11 kilograms (24 lb) of food. Sometimes, concentrated feed such as grain is fed in addition to pasture or hay, especially when the animal is very active.en grain is fed, equine nutritionists recommend that 50% or more of the animal's diet by weight should still be forage.

Horses require a plentiful supply of clean water, a minimum of 38 to 45 litres (10 to 12 US gal) per day.gh horses are adapted to live outside, they require shelter from the wind and precipitation, which can range from a simple shed or shelter to an elaborate stable.

Horses require routine hoof care from a farrier, as well as vaccinations to protect against various diseases, and dental examinations from a veterinarian or a specialized equine dentist.If horses are kept inside in a barn, they require regular daily exercise for their physical health and mental well-being. When turned outside, they require well-maintained, sturdy fences to be safely contained.ar grooming is also helpful to help the horse maintain good health of the hair coat and underlying skin.
